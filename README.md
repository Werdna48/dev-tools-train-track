# Development Tools Train Track

Instructions for the Development tools (VS Code) train track

## Installation

### Python

There are many different ways to install Python depending on your OS and preferences. Real Python give a nice list of them here
https://realpython.com/installing-python/

For the uninitated, there is a substantial difference between Python versions 2 & 3, which means most code written for one won't work for the other by default. Python 2 has been deprecated since 2020, so we will be working with Python 3 exclusively. Therefore, please make sure the Python you have installed is version 3 (e.g `python --version`), or ensure you always use the `python3` and `pip3` aliases.

### Python packages

One of the major strengths of Python compared to other programming languages is the vast amount of 3rd party packages available, which come in all shapes and sizes (you can even write one yourself pretty easily!). However, with this vastness comes a fair bit of complexity in managing shared dependencies, particularly ones that require specific versions. To get around this, it is common to create a fresh "environment" for each project/workspace and install only the packages you need for it in order to avoid clashes.

### Install VS Code + extensions
